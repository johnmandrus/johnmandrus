## 🚀 About Me
I do a little bit of everything, and I try to do it as well as possible. I'm a software engineer with professional experience in defense electronics manufacturing, test equipment, and embedded systems. I'm completing a graduate degree in data science in machine learning with academic experience in object detection and mechanical failure prediction. In past roles I've successfully recruited and hired engineers, organized 200+ person networking events, and helped plan a factory move. In my free time I love to run trails, rock climb, read, and code.
